Caroline is a game that asks the question "why do we kill people who kill people, to teach them that killing is wrong?". Itâ€™s a 2D game, gameplaybased, where you control a girl lost in a forest and her unique chance to survive is accept the help of a strange (but friendly) guy. The characters are inspired by known Brazilian legends, but they are affected by the influence of the catholic church that turned them into demons!!

## History

"Caroline" is being developed by DotCompany, composed only by one member, Felipe Magagnin (me). The development of the game started as a hobby but with the passage of time became a serious project, but its development can only be done on weekends and breaks because of work and college. My dream is to be able to develop the game as a work, having much more time for its development and being able to develop much more content.

##Features
